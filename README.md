## Prerequisites:
1. Ensure Java and Maven is installed.
2. Make sure Firefox is installed.
3. Retrieve the GeckoDriver for Firefox either from the official website (or locate it within your Repository or zip file). Then, incorporate its location into your system's PATH variable. If you're using a Mac, make certain it resides in `/usr/local/bin/`.
4. Your project should include dependencies for Selenium and JUnit.

## Running the Test Suite
1. Save the provided test code into a file named `WayneUniTest.java` inside your project.
2. Ensure project's build tool (like Maven) is correctly set up to include the necessary dependencies.
3. Navigate to the directory in `src/test/java` and Locate `WayneUniTest.java`.
4. Compile and run the test using your IDE by Building the Project first and Running the Main Method next
5. Observe the results.

## Notes:
- Ensure that the hardcoded path to the GeckoDriver (`"/usr/local/bin/geckodriver"`) in the code matches the path on your system.
